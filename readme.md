# Wheel Check Data Aggregator

***Wheel check data aggregator*** is a useful tool that helps to improve [***Wheel check***](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/lut-generator-for-ac.9740/)'s log files by aggregating data to emphasize the behavior of your steering wheel and eliminating reading errors.

...but what does it mean? what is data aggregation?

## Data Aggregation example (with Logitech G29)

Data aggregation is a widely used process that helps to extract the behavior of a set of raw data by mitigating reading errors. It's used mostly in advanced security and control systems (sensors networks, alarms). 

In the following graph you can see an example of a generated log file for a ***Logitech G29***. The red line represents the raw data collected by the standard [***Wheel check***](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/lut-generator-for-ac.9740/) calibration procedure, while the blue line is the improved output file generated by ***Wheel Check Data Aggregator***.

With this utility, you can choose the degree of data aggregation (named aggregation order) by editing the ***config.json*** file:

 - For geared wheels - like Logitech G29 or G27 - I suggest aggregation values between 3 and 5 (4 is perfect in my case).
 - For mixed wheels - like Thrustmaster TXM or T150 - 3 should be fine.
 - For belt wheels - like Thrustmaster T300 - I suggest lower values like 3 or even 2.
 - For direct wheels 2 should be the perfect choice. 
```
{
	"input_file":"example.csv",
	"aggregation_order":5
}
```


To run the utility, just put your [***Wheel check***](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/lut-generator-for-ac.9740/)'s log file (*example.csv*) in the program folder and execute ***WheelCheckDataAggregator.jar***:

If everything goes well, you should get the following output message:

You can use generated log files as [***Lut Generator***](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/lut-generator-for-ac.9740/) input to improve generated lut files:
